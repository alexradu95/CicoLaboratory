/// # Building UI in StereoKit
/// 
/// StereoKit uses an immediate mode UI system. Basically, you define the UI 
/// every single frame you want to see it! Sounds a little odd at first, but
/// it does have some pretty tremendous advantages. Since very little state
/// is actually stored, you can add, remove, and change your UI elements with
/// trivial and standard code structures! You'll find that you often have
/// much less UI code, with far fewer places for things to go wrong.
///
/// The goal for this UI API is to get you up and running as fast as possible
/// with a working UI! This does mean trading some design flexibility for API 
/// simplicity, but we also strive to retain configurability for those that
/// need a little extra.
